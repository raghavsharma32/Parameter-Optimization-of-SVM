# SVM Optimization Project

Optimize Support Vector Machines (SVM) for multi-class classification using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project explores the best hyperparameters across multiple samples, evaluates performance, and visualizes the results.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Multi-Sample Testing**: Evaluates 10 different dataset splits.
- ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tunes kernel, C (nu), and epsilon for optimal performance.
- 📈 **Convergence Plot**: Visualizes accuracy progression for the best-performing sample.
- 📊 **Results in CSV**: Saves accuracy and hyperparameters for each sample in a CSV file.
